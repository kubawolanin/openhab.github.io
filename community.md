openHAB is proud to be a community driven project maintained by a passionate and growing community. Since its very beginning openHAB captured the attention of home automation enthusiasts and now thousands of homes worldwide are controlled through openHAB software.


To make it easy and effective for our users to communicate with each other and to provide support to them a powerful platform for community discussions has been established:

* [openHAB Forum](https://community.openhab.org)

Furthermore we maintain several other communication channels:

* [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/issues)
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/104057398315501111932)
* [KNX Users Forum [german]](http://knx-user-forum.de/openhab/)

There are other channels, which we do not officially maintain, but where there is a good chance to find support from other users on specific topics or in specific languages:

* [Smart Home Open Source Chinese Forum](http://bbs.open-smart.cn/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=46)
